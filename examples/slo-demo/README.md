# Kubernetes SLO Demo

This repository contains a practical demonstration of Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and Service Level Agreements (SLAs) using a Python Flask application on Kubernetes, monitored by Prometheus and Grafana.

## Purpose

The goal of this demo is to show how to measure and visualize service reliability. It simulates a realistic service with occasional failures and latency, allowing you to see how these impact your SLIs, SLOs, and error budgets.

## Why SLO and SLA measurements matter

Measuring service levels is fundamental to Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). It allows teams to:
* **Quantify reliability:** Move from "the service feels slow" to "95th percentile latency is 1.2s".
* **Manage error budgets:** Use data to decide when to focus on features vs. reliability.
* **Define clear expectations:** Align engineering, product, and customers on what "reliable" means.
* **Alert on what matters:** Reduce alert fatigue by alerting on SLO consumption rather than individual component failures.

## Definitions

* **SLI (Service Level Indicator):** The actual measured behavior. In this demo, it is the percentage of successful HTTP requests (2xx status codes).
* **SLO (Service Level Objective):** Internal target (99.9%).
* **SLA (Service Level Agreement):** Contractual commitment (99.5%).
* **Error Budget:** The allowable unreliability (0.1% for our 99.9% SLO).

## Prerequisites

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/)
* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
* A Kubernetes cluster with **Prometheus Operator** and **Grafana** already installed (e.g., via `kube-prometheus-stack`).

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Create or select the Kind cluster

If you don't have a cluster yet:

```bash
kind create cluster --name slo-demo
```

### 2. Build the local image

Build the application image locally. We use a local tag to avoid the need for an external registry.

```bash
docker build -t slo-demo:0.1.0 .
```

### 3. Load the image into Kind

This command copies the locally built image into the Kind node's container runtime.

```bash
kind load docker-image slo-demo:0.1.0 --name slo-demo
```

### 4. Deploy the application

Apply the namespace and application manifests:

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/app.yaml
```

### 5. Deploy the ServiceMonitor

The ServiceMonitor tells Prometheus to scrape metrics from our application.

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/servicemonitor.yaml
```

*Note: Ensure the `release: kube-prometheus-stack` label in `k8s/servicemonitor.yaml` matches your Prometheus installation.*

### 6. Verify the Prometheus target

Check the Prometheus UI (Targets page) to ensure `slo-demo` is discovered and being scraped successfully. You can port-forward Prometheus to access it:

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n monitoring svc/prometheus-operated 9090
```

### 7. Deploy the load generator

The load generator produces a deterministic pattern of traffic: ~99.7% success rate.

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/load-generator.yaml
```

### 8. Import the Grafana dashboard

1. Open your Grafana UI.
2. Go to **Dashboards** -> **Import**.
3. Upload the `grafana/slo-dashboard.json` file.
4. Select your Prometheus datasource.

## Interpreting the Dashboard

The dashboard consists of six key panels:

1. **Availability vs SLO and SLA:** A time-series view of actual availability compared to our 99.9% SLO and 99.5% SLA lines.
2. **Current Availability:** A single stat showing the most recent availability measurement.
3. **Error Budget Remaining:** A gauge showing how much of your error budget (based on the 99.9% SLO) remains for the selected time range.
4. **Request Rate:** Total traffic volume, grouped by HTTP status code.
5. **HTTP 5xx Error Rate:** A focused view of server-side errors.
6. **P95 Request Latency:** The 95th percentile latency, highlighting the "slow" requests.

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check Pods
kubectl get pods -n slo-demo

# Check Service
kubectl get service -n slo-demo

# Check ServiceMonitor
kubectl get servicemonitor -n slo-demo

# Access the application locally
kubectl port-forward -n slo-demo service/slo-demo 8080:80

# Test endpoints manually
curl http://localhost:8080/
curl http://localhost:8080/fail
curl http://localhost:8080/metrics
```

## Troubleshooting

* **Image not found:** Ensure you ran `kind load docker-image`. Kind cannot pull images from your local Docker daemon directly without this step.
* **No metrics in Grafana:** 
    * Verify the ServiceMonitor is selected by Prometheus (check the `release` label).
    * Ensure the application Pods are running and `/metrics` is reachable.
    * Check if the `namespace` variable in Grafana is set to `slo-demo`.
* **Zero availability:** If there is no traffic, the availability calculation may show `N/A`. Ensure the load generator is running.

## Cleanup

```bash
kubectl delete -f k8s/load-generator.yaml
kubectl delete -f k8s/servicemonitor.yaml
kubectl delete -f k8s/app.yaml
kind delete cluster --name slo-demo
```

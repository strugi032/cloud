# Cloud Infrastructure & DevOps Portfolio

A DevOps / Platform Engineering portfolio repository for cloud infrastructure examples, automation notes, and practical cloud-native patterns.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a collection of infrastructure-as-code (IaC), automation scripts, and documentation for various cloud services and platform engineering concepts.

## Repository Structure

- `ansible/`: Ansible playbooks and roles for configuration management.
- `docs/`: In-depth documentation, ADRs (Architectural Decision Records), and checklists for cloud operations.
- `templates/`: Reusable IaC templates (e.g., AWS KMS, Security Groups).
